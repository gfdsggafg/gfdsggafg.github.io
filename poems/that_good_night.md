# Fly, Please Fly Gentle into that Good Night

Fly, please fly gentle into that good night\
When the falling sun sinks. Darkness's onset.\
And now embrace the dying of the light.\

The black pigeon, your feather in the flight\
Sparkles like burning in today's sunset.\
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.\

Icarus, tried to catch the sun, its bright\
-Ness, then he fell and sank. Without regret.\
And now embrace the dying of the light.\

Knowing dark is coming, the owls are right.\
The ghost-like scops-owls call and off they set:\
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.\

The coal-black feather once sparkles in sight\
Merge into darkness. You the sun forget.\
And now embrace the dying of the light.\

And you, black pigeon, stand at a great height,\
And spread your wings, as the sun falls. Duet.\
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.\
And now embrace the dying of the light.\
