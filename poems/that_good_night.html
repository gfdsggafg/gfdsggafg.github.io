<h1>Fly, Please Fly Gentle into that Good Night</h1>
<p>Fly, please fly gentle into that good night<br/>
When the falling sun sinks. Darkness's onset.<br/>
And now embrace the dying of the light.</p>

<p>The black pigeon, your feather in the flight<br/>
Sparkles like burning in today's sunset.<br/>
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Icarus, tried to catch the sun, its bright<br/>
-Ness, then he fell and sank. Without regret.<br/>
And now embrace the dying of the light.</p>

<p>Knowing dark is coming, the owls are right.<br/>
The ghost-like scops-owls call and off they set:<br/>
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>The coal-black feather once sparkles in sight<br/>
Merge into darkness. You the sun forget.<br/>
And now embrace the dying of the light.</p>

<p>And you, black pigeon, stand at a great height,<br/>
And spread your wings, as the sun falls. Duet.<br/>
Fly, please fly gentle into that good night.<br/>
And now embrace the dying of the light.<p>
